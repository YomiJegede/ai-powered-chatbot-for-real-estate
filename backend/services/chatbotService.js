// This service processes user queries related to the chatbot, which can be expanded depending on your chatbot integration (e.g., Dialogflow).
// In the real implementation, you'd likely replace the processChatMessage function with something more sophisticated, like an integration with Dialogflow or another NLP API.
// Dummy service for handling chatbot logic
// This is where you could integrate with Dialogflow, Watson, or another chatbot platform.
